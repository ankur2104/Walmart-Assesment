# SeatReservationSystem


# Maven Commands:
1. mvn clean install (To run the test cases and generate the SeatReservation-1.0.0.jar).


# Implementation:
Following data model/POJO's has been implemented
* Consumer: Contains consumer information like Name,emailId,ConsumerId.
* Seat: Contains Seat co-ordinates in a matrix (like 0th row,4th seat) 
* SeatHold: Contains list of seats and reserved/hold information and the time it is put on hold
* A map is maintained for the seats in 3 different states (Available,Hold,Reserved)

 

# Assumptions/Note: 
* It is assumed that lower number seats are nearest to screen and are the best seats available from the customer perspective.This can be enhanced to include more business rules.   
* The current system design might not work in the distributed systems.That will require use of distributed/centralized caching or persistence layer.
* The input for the number of seats (rows and columns ) is maintained in externalize property files.
* There is no validation for the customer email ID.
* Used System.out statements in this project. Ideally we should use some loggin framework to better manage the logging
