# SeatReservationSystem


# Maven Commands:
1. mvn clean install (To run the test cases and generate the SeatReservation-1.0.0.jar)


# Implementation:
Following data model/POJO's has been implemented
* Consumer: Contains consumer information like Name,emailId,ConsumerId.
* Seat: Contains Seat co-ordinates in a matrix (like 0th row,4th seat) 
* SeatHold: Contains list of seats and reserved/hold information and the time it is put on hold 



# Note: 
* Test cases are certainly not enough. I would take care of that for sure.
* Right now, this finds available seats based on linearly. But I would enhance that as well. I meant, if user requests n no of seats and if second last row has that in one row, then i would like to take them compare to taking couple of seats from last row and remaining from second last.
